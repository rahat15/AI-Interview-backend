### INSTRUCTIONS & RUBRICS

**1. General Rules:**
- For each dimension, provide a score based on the provided CV and Job Description.
- For the `evidence` field in each subscore, you MUST provide an array of direct, concise quotes from the CV that justify your score.
- If no evidence can be found for a dimension, the score MUST be 0 and the `evidence` array must contain the single string "No evidence found.".

**2. PART 1: CV QUALITY (100 points total)**
Evaluate the CV's intrinsic quality, independent of the job description.
- ats_structure (10): Contact details are clear, sections are well-defined, bullets are easily parseable, dates are consistent.
- writing_clarity (15): Concise, uses active voice (e.g., "Led," "Developed"), parallel bullet structure, no typos or grammatical errors.
- quantified_impact (20): Uses specific metrics (% / $ / user numbers / latency reduction) to show the impact of actions.
- technical_depth (15): Mentions specific, non-generic tools/frameworks/architectures. Shows understanding of complex systems.
- projects_portfolio (10): Includes links to a portfolio, GitHub, or describes personal/open-source projects with outcomes.
- leadership_skills (10): Provides evidence of leading teams, mentoring others, project ownership, or significant cross-functional work.
- career_progression (10): Shows increasing responsibility over time. Timeline is clear and logical.
- consistency (10): Formatting, tone, and verb tenses are consistent throughout the document. No large, unexplained career gaps.

**3. PART 2: JOB MATCH (100 points total)**
Evaluate how well the CV matches the specific Job Description.
- hard_skills (35): Coverage of "must-have" technical skills, tools, and frameworks from the JD. Consider exact, alias (e.g., AWS vs. Amazon Web Services), and semantic matches.
- responsibilities (15): Overlap between the candidate's experience (verbs and outcomes) and the key responsibilities listed in the JD.
- domain_relevance (10): Match of the candidate's industry experience (e.g., FinTech, SaaS, AI) with the company's domain.
- seniority (10): Candidate's years of relevant experience vs. JD requirements (e.g., "5+ years").
- nice_to_haves (5): Coverage of optional skills or "bonus points" mentioned in the JD.
- education_certs (5): Match for required or preferred degrees and certifications.
- recent_achievements (10): Candidate's accomplishments in the last 1-2 roles directly align with the core needs of the job.
- constraints (10): Match on practical constraints like location, work authorization, or travel. If not mentioned, assume a match.

**4. PART 3: KEY TAKEAWAYS**
Based on your full analysis, identify critical highlights.
- red_flags: List any critical deal-breakers. A red flag is a clear mismatch on a non-negotiable requirement (e.g., JD requires US work authorization, CV states candidate needs sponsorship; JD requires a specific security clearance the candidate lacks).
- green_flags: List 2-3 standout qualifications that make the candidate exceptionally strong for this role.
