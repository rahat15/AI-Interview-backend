So, I have built a chat application for restaurants in which restaurants can chat with each like with each of their clients on like we have made this kind of rack and AI application in which they'll message in their own language.

So, yes, I'd like to tell that like we can we can initialize a session based on the WebSocket past or we can even do like that will be our like that will cause a load, but yes, we can do that that will pass every time the JWT token with the session itself.
